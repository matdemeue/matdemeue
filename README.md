# Hello world... I mean hello there! 👋.

## 🙋🏻‍ I'm Mathieu... and you are? <br>
As a Drupal developer I'm enthousiast about everything open source related. So I try to contribute as much as possible to the Drupal project on [drupal.org](https://drupal.org/u/matdemeue). <br/>
In 2021 I joined Calibrate (Cronos Group) in Ghent as a Drupal developer and I'm still kicking some ass over there. With our great team we maintain hundreds of clients and projects and are still growing. <br/>


Besides my fulltime job at Calibrate, I'm also running a small side-business names Smashing Impact which started in 2018. After 5 years it was time for something new so by that I'm building a SaaS service for small business owners and SME's to be visible online for an affordable price. 
But that's not the only thing, after following a copywriting course I'm now able to provide my clients a website and also kick-ass content to fill it up for them.<br>

## 📫 Get in touch.

## 🌱 Some seeds that are planted but still need to grow.

As a developer you can always learn new things and new technologies. Specific for Drupal I want to improve by using layout builder more instead of paragraphs. I also want to learn more about custom modules and more complicated back-end stuff. <br /><br />
You can't build a beautiful website and keep it offline, so I also want to learn some more about DevOps and specific about Docker and it's containerized setup, how to deploy a stack in Docker and also about deployment pipelines with Jenkins.
